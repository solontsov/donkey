I have a div element <div class="donkey-game"></div>. It is styled:
.donkey-game {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(5, 1fr);
    gap: 2px;
    border: 5px solid #022;
}
How to calculate position of a child element number N without adding it?

To calculate the position of a child element number N in a grid container without adding it, you can use the following formula:

Calculate the row number: row = Math.ceil(N / number of columns)
Calculate the column number: column = (N - 1) % number of columns + 1
In your case, the grid container has 4 columns. So for a child element number N, its row number would be Math.ceil(N / 4) and its column number would be (N - 1) % 4 + 1.

Is there anything else you would like to know?
